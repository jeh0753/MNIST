Deep Learning with MNIST Dataset
================================
This is a project that gains high-level accurate predictions of numerical results using the MNIST dataset. It runs the model through the following processes:
1. A simple linear model
2. A fully connected, single layer neural network
3. A convolutional neural network (CNN)
4. A CNN with Batch Normalization

Dropout and Data Augmentation techniques are used to control for overfitting. Basic ensembling is used to achieve the best possible final results.

Installation
------------
1. Run the requirements file
2. Open MNIST_Jakes.ipynb, and follow the process

Requirements
------------
A GPU is needed to run this notebook - an AWS P2 instance works well.
